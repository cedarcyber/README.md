Welcome to my small and growing list of mostly-free security scanners and toolz that have personally come in handy in the course of an incident investigations, assessments, and vigorous troubleshooting a configuration. These are the tools I like to have in my back pocket and the purpose of this repo is mostly for me to have easy reference to these tools as time goes on since I don't trust browser bookmarks.

*Many of these tools have paid versions or APIs to use more advanced features but the freemium options are great places to start.*
