# Security & IT Tool Starter Pack

A small but growing list of mostly-free security scanners and tools that come in handy in the course of an incident investigation, tool assessment, or troubleshooting a configuration. These are the tools I like to have in my back pocket and the purpose of this repo is mostly for me to have easy reference to these tools as time goes on.
